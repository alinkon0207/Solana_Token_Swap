My audit results are the following.
1. Found a serious bug in accept_offer function.
Because the developer didn't understand token exchange logic, he was confused with offering & request on accept. So he coded wrong accept_offer function.
I found this bug and wrote this function nearly new.
2. Coded unit-test script and experimented in localnet to verify the accuracy of smart contract.
In fact, this is a developer's task. But he didn't this task nearly at all.
So I coded unit-test script and made sure the experiment result and my manual calculations are identical.
3. Found a potential bug.
TOKEN_DECIMALS must not be set as a high value (above 8). Below or equal to 6 is recommended.
Because in our smart contract, it performs big-number multiplication & divison so it is possible that overflow could occur.
Therfore, we should pay attention to token decimals and make sure overflow couldn't occur.
4. Reviewed all account security checks and complemented missing parts
  Due to incomplete account security check, Warmhole Solana to ETH bridge was hacked and about 155M$ was stolen. Account security check is so important.
  But the junior dev couldn't complete account security check.
  So I reviewed all security checks and complemented missing parts.
